# Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I am Majed Turkistani![](https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=DrMajed86)
#### Assistant Professor of Paleontology and Stratigraphy

## About Me
Hello! I'm Dr. Majed Turkistani, a passionate and dedicated paleontologist and stratigrapher with a Ph.D. from McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. As an Assistant Professor at the Department of Petroleum Geology & Sedimentology, Faculty of Earth Sciences at King Abdulaziz University, I am deeply immersed in the study of paleontology, stratigraphy, and biostratigraphy in both modern and ancient environments.
My expertise lies in unraveling the secrets of ancient deltaic environments and marginal marine settings. I employ microfossils as key tools in reconstructing paleoenvironments, offering insights into our planet's rich and diverse history. My work is not just confined to the past; it has significant implications for understanding current environmental challenges and future predictions.
Beyond the traditional realms of geology, I have developed intermediate skills in R, Python, HTML, CSS, Graphic Design, and Machine Learning. This unique blend of expertise enables me to leverage cutting-edge technology in my research, enhancing the analysis and interpretation of fossil data.
I am continuously striving to improve my English language skills, as I believe effective communication is crucial in sharing knowledge and fostering international collaborations.
When I'm not delving into the depths of geology, you can find me with a camera in hand, exploring the beauty of the natural world through photography, a hobby that perfectly complements my professional interests. I'm also an avid reader and traveler, always eager to learn about different cultures and perspectives, which further enriches my understanding of the world.
